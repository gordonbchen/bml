## Abstract
* What is the problem this paper addresses?
* Why is it an important problem?
* Why are current approaches insufficient?
* Methods: In this work, we develop an approach to address these deficiencies

## Problem definition
* What question are you trying to solve?
* Observed and unobserved random variables?
* What is the goal of the project?

## Models and Methods
* Describe the model and inference algorithms.
* Graphical and generative model.
* What parameters do we estimate and how?
* What is the interpretation of those parameters, how do they solve the problem?

## Results and Validation
* What will your results show?
* How will you quanify how well your approach answered the question?
* What other models and methods will you compare against?
* How do you validate your answers and uncertainty?
* What figures/tables will you use?
